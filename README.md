# Memory Game Project

## How to play

Click the cards to reveal their picture. Try to memorize it and find matches.
You win only when you match all the cards. (anchor = anchor or diamond = diamond)
The more moves you make, the worse your rating gets. Time has no meaning in your rating, so don't feel pressured.
